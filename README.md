## Prompts

- Provide follow up questions
- Suggest defaults


Think of an AI prompt like a recipe or a brief for a freelancer. The more specific the constraints,  
the less likely you are to get a "hallucinated" or generic mess. 

To get the best results, a high-quality prompt usually consists of these five basic parameters:

### 1. The Persona (Who are you?)

Assigning a role sets the tone, vocabulary, and expertise level.

* *Example:* "Act as a senior software engineer" vs. "Act as a five-year-old."

### 2. The Task (What do you want?)

Be direct and use action verbs. Clearly define the goal.

* *Example:* "Summarize this article," "Write a Python script," or "Brainstorm five marketing slogans."

### 3. Context & Constraints (What are the rules?)

This is where you provide the "meat." Give the AI the background info it needs and set boundaries on what it *cannot* do.

* *Example:* "Use a professional tone," "Keep it under 200 words," or "Do not use technical jargon."

### 4. Format (How should it look?)

Tell the AI exactly how to structure the output so you don't have to reformat it yourself.

* *Example:* A bulleted list, a Markdown table, a JSON object, or a three-paragraph email.

### 5. Exemplars (Show, don't just tell)

Providing a single example (often called "one-shot prompting") dramatically improves accuracy.

* *Example:* "Format the data like this: Name: [Name], Age: [Age]."


### The "Perfect Prompt" Framework

If you combine these, your prompt structure looks like this:

| Parameter | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Persona** | You are an expert career coach. |
| **Task** | Rewrite my resume bullet points to be more impact-oriented. |
| **Context** | I am applying for a Project Manager role at a tech startup. |
| **Constraint** | Use the "Action Verb + Task + Result" formula. |
| **Format** | Present the changes in a "Before vs. After" table. |

> **Quick Tip:** If the AI's first response is "meh," don't start over. Just give it a follow-up
> instruction like, "Make it punchier" or "Add more data points."





## Major Human Revolutions

The following table presents a chronological overview of the major revolutions that   
have shaped human history, highlighting the pivotal shifts in cognition, technology,  
science, and society that transformed how people live, work, and understand the world.  
Each entry captures a moment when new capabilities or ways of thinking unlocked dramatic  
changes in culture, economics, and human potential, illustrating the accelerating pace  
of innovation from prehistory to the present.  

| Revolution | Approx. Date | Summary |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Cognitive Revolution** | ~70,000 BCE | Emergence of complex language, symbolic thought, and shared myths, enabling large‑scale cooperation, rapid innovation, and the cultural foundations of human societies. |
| **Agricultural Revolution** | ~10,000 BCE | Transition from nomadic foraging to settled farming, creating food surpluses, population growth, labor specialization, and the rise of villages and early cities. |
| **Bronze Age Technological Revolution** | ~3300 BCE | Development of bronze tools and weapons; advances in writing, metallurgy, and transportation that expanded trade and supported early complex societies. |
| **Iron Age Technological Revolution** | ~1200–500 BCE | Widespread use of iron tools and weapons, boosting agricultural productivity, infrastructure building, and the growth of larger interconnected civilizations. |
| **Printing Revolution** | 15th century | Gutenberg’s movable‑type press enabled mass book production, lowering the cost of knowledge and accelerating literacy, science, religion, and cultural exchange. |
| **Scientific Revolution** | 16th–17th centuries | Rise of empirical observation, experimentation, and mathematical reasoning, leading to major breakthroughs in physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry. |
| **Industrial Revolution** | 18th–19th centuries | Mechanization, steam power, and factory production transformed economies, increased productivity, drove urbanization, and reshaped global trade and labor. |
| **Chemical Revolution** | Late 18th century | Establishment of modern chemistry—elements, reactions, conservation of mass—enabling advances in medicine, materials, agriculture, and industry. |
| **Electrical Revolution** | 19th–early 20th centuries | Harnessing electricity for lighting, communication, and power, enabling telegraphs, telephones, electric motors, and modern infrastructure. |
| **Digital Revolution** | Mid‑20th century to present | Computers, semiconductors, and the internet reshaped information, communication, work, and industry through automation and global connectivity. |
| **Biotechnology Revolution** | Late 20th century to present | Advances in genetics, DNA sequencing, and gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) enabling precise biological manipulation for medicine, agriculture, and synthetic biology. |
| **AI Revolution** | 21st century to present | Rapid progress in machine learning and large‑scale computation enabling systems that perform cognitive tasks, analyze data, generate content, and automate knowledge work. |
