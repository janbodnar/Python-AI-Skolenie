## Clarity & Specificity

- Be specific: Avoid vague language to get more focused results
- Limit scope: Narrow your focus to a single aspect of a topic to avoid scattered answers
- Use keywords strategically: Incorporate important phrases and keywords into your prompts
- Don't mix unrelated ideas: Keep your prompt focused on a single topic or task

---

## Context & Purpose

- Provide background information: Give the AI relevant details for better output
- Include audience and objective: Tell the AI who the audience is and the main goal
- State constraints: Specify any limitations or requirements for the response
- Use "do" and "don't": Give the AI clear instructions on what to include or exclude

---

## Action & Format

- Use action-oriented language: Begin prompts with verbs to clearly define the task
- Set the desired output format: Specify if you want a summary, list, or specific structure
- Tell the AI what to avoid: Explicitly state any biases or opinions to remove
- Use frameworks and templates: Structure your prompts for better results
- Ask for justification: Prompt the AI to explain or justify its reasoning

## Tone & Style

- Consider tone and audience: Tailor the language to fit a specific audience or context
- Use "Act as if...": Instruct the AI to take on a specific persona for a unique perspective

---

## Iteration & Refinement

- Iterate and refine: Don't accept the first answer; make changes to your prompt for improvement
- Evaluate the AI's response: Check for accuracy, relevance, and completeness before refining
- Repeat the process: Continue refining your prompt until you get the desired outcome
- Make tiny tweaks: Small changes to a prompt can lead to significantly better results
- Use the AI to refine prompts: You can converse with the AI to help you generate better prompts

## Advanced Techniques

- Force it to take a side: Use debate-style prompts to explore different viewpoints
- Save good prompts: Keep a record of your most effective prompts for future use
- Don't treat AI as a mind reader: Give explicit instructions; it won't guess your intent
- Get ideas from the AI: Use it to brainstorm topics and post ideas
- Rephrase the prompt: If a prompt isn't working, try rephrasing it
- Specify a length: Ask for the response to be a specific number of sentences or words
- Be patient: Accept that the first answer is rarely perfect; it's a tool to guide you
