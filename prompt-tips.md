## How to Write Effective AI Prompts

To write effective AI prompts:

- Be clear and specific
- Provide context and examples
- Use action-oriented language
- Set the desired tone, style, and length for the response
- Iterate for improvement

---

## Clarity & Specificity

- Be specific: Avoid vague language to get more focused results
- Limit scope: Narrow your focus to a single aspect of a topic to avoid scattered answers
- Use keywords strategically: Incorporate important phrases and keywords into your prompts
- Don't mix unrelated ideas: Keep your prompt focused on a single topic or task

---

## Context & Purpose

- Provide background information: Give the AI relevant details for better output
- Include audience and objective: Tell the AI who the audience is and the main goal
- State constraints: Specify any limitations or requirements for the response
- Use "do" and "don't": Give the AI clear instructions on what to include or exclude

---

## Action & Format

- Use action-oriented language: Begin prompts with verbs to clearly define the task
- Set the desired output format: Specify if you want a summary, list, or specific structure
- Tell the AI what to avoid: Explicitly state any biases or opinions to remove
- Use frameworks and templates: Structure your prompts for better results
- Ask for justification: Prompt the AI to explain or justify its reasoning

---

## Tone & Style

- Consider tone and audience: Tailor the language to fit a specific audience or context
- Use "Act as if...": Instruct the AI to take on a specific persona for a unique perspective

---

## Role Setting & Personas

- **Define a clear role or persona**: Use "You are..." or "Act as..." to set the AI's identity
- **Be specific about expertise**: Specify the level and type of expertise (e.g., "senior developer", "beginner-friendly tutor")
- **Include relevant context for the role**: Give background information that fits the persona
- **Use professional roles**: Teacher, consultant, critic, analyst, researcher, coach, mentor
- **Try creative personas**: Historical figures, fictional characters, or industry experts
- **Combine roles when useful**: "Act as both a code reviewer and security expert"
- **Set role-appropriate constraints**: A teacher should explain simply; an expert can use technical jargon
- **Maintain consistency**: Keep the same role throughout a conversation for coherent responses
- **Use roles to shape output style**: Different roles naturally produce different tones and formats
- **Examples of effective role prompts**:
  - "You are an experienced Python developer reviewing code for best practices"
  - "Act as a patient teacher explaining concepts to a beginner"
  - "You are a technical writer creating clear documentation"
  - "Act as a skeptical code reviewer looking for potential bugs"

## Iteration & Refinement

- Iterate and refine: Don't accept the first answer; make changes to your prompt for improvement
- Evaluate the AI's response: Check for accuracy, relevance, and completeness before refining
- Repeat the process: Continue refining your prompt until you get the desired outcome
- Make tiny tweaks: Small changes to a prompt can lead to significantly better results
- Use the AI to refine prompts: You can converse with the AI to help you generate better prompts

---

## Advanced Techniques

- Use analogies: Prompt the AI to explain complex topics with simple analogies
- Give examples (few-shot prompting): Provide examples of the desired output to guide the AI
- Ask open-ended questions: Encourage more detailed and thoughtful responses
- Ask for depth: If the response is shallow, ask for more detailed information
- Force it to take a side: Use debate-style prompts to explore different viewpoints
- Save good prompts: Keep a record of your most effective prompts for future use
- Don't treat AI as a mind reader: Give explicit instructions; it won't guess your intent
- Get ideas from the AI: Use it to brainstorm topics and post ideas
- Rephrase the prompt: If a prompt isn't working, try rephrasing it
- Specify a length: Ask for the response to be a specific number of sentences or words
- Be patient: Accept that the first answer is rarely perfect; it's a tool to guide you

---

- Provide plan for the code changes/plan mode.
- Break down large tasks into small, incremental steps.
- Think of the end state and then prompt steps to get there
- Define 5-10 rules upfront for new projects
- Maintain a diary file for complex multi-chat sessions
- Tream prompt like mini specs with stack, behaviour and constraints
- Reference exising code
- Commit regularly
