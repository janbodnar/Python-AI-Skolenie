Notes:
- Country uses the organization's primary headquarters or the country most
	commonly attributed to the organization in public sources.
- Links point to either an official 'about' or product page. For community
	model releases (e.g., Falcon on Hugging Face, Moonshot on Hugging Face), a
	secondary site (Hugging Face model card) is also cited where it clarifies the
	model's publisher.
