# Introduction to OpenAI

**OpenAI** is an artificial intelligence research laboratory and company known for developing  
advanced AI models, including the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series. Their models  
power applications like natural language processing, code generation, and conversational agents.  
OpenAI provides APIs that allow developers to integrate AI capabilities into their own applications,  
making it easier to build intelligent, interactive, and automated systems. 

The **OpenAI library** is an official Python package developed by OpenAI to simplify working  
with their AI models. It lets you easily integrate powerful language models like GPT-4  
into your applications using straightforward Python code. You can send prompts, receive  
AI-generated responses, and manage API requests without complex setup.  
The library handles authentication, formatting, and parsing, so you can focus on building chatbots,  
content tools, or automation. Designed for simplicity, it makes advanced AI accessible  
even for developers new to machine learning.  


## Create a ChatGPT Platform Account

1. Open your browser and go to **[https://platform.chatgpt.com](https://platform.chatgpt.com)** (you may be redirected to OpenAI’s developer platform).
2. Sign in with an existing account or create a new one using email, Google, or Microsoft.
3. Verify your email address if prompted.


## Add Billing and Credit

1. After logging in, open the **Billing** section from the dashboard.
2. Add a payment method (credit/debit card).
3. Purchase credits or enable pay-as-you-go billing.

> API usage requires an active billing setup.

## Create an API Key

1. In the dashboard, go to **API Keys**.
2. Click **Create new secret key**.
3. Copy the key and store it securely.

⚠️ Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it or commit it to source control.

## Install the OpenAI Client Library

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
pip install openai
```


## Configure Your API Key

### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)

**PowerShell**:

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

## Basic Python Example

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Write a haiku about Python on Windows."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

This example demonstrates the simplest way to send a prompt to a ChatGPT model using the  
OpenAI Python SDK and retrieve the model’s text output. It uses the `responses.create()` method  
and the `output_text` convenience property, which automatically extracts and concatenates all text  
generated by the model into a single string. This approach is ideal for quick scripts, prototypes,  
and command-line tools where only the final text response is needed.  


## Next Steps

* Review usage limits and pricing in the dashboard
* Explore different models for cost vs. quality
* Store secrets securely (e.g., Windows Credential Manager or .env files)
